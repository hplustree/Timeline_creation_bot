# Timeline Generator Bot

This project allows users to upload a DOCX or PDF file containing project requirements, and automatically generates a project timeline in Excel format. The timeline includes details about project modules, tasks, and subtasks, along with the estimated time (in days and hours) for each task. The final output includes formatted Excel files with merged cells, borders, and font styling for clarity.
